Anglers can find ample opportunities for bass, crappie, catfish, and other popular sport fish in the flowing waters of the Alabama and Tombigbee Rivers, large impoundments like Guntersville Reservoir, and coastal rivers such as the expansive Mobile-Tensaw Delta. Sampling and data collection are central to maintaining healthy fish populations for both conservation and recreation, and fisheries biologists regularly monitor these populations to ensure Alabama’s fisheries remain abundant, balanced, and enjoyable for anglers of all skill levels.\n\nBoat Ramps and Access: Outdoor Alabama Freshwater Boating Access"

    "text": "Fisheries biologists use several key metrics to track and manage fish populations. CPUE (Catch-per-Unit-Effort) measures how many fish are caught per unit of effort, helping compare abundance across lakes and years. PSD (Proportional Stock Density) and RSD (Relative Stock Density) show the proportion of larger fish in the population, with RSD highlighting preferred, memorable, and trophy-size fish. Relative weight (Wr) compares a fish’s weight to what’s typical for its length, providing an indicator of overall health and condition. Together, these metrics give biologists a clear picture of population trends, growth, and the overall quality of Alabama’s fisheries.\nBoat Ramps and Access: Outdoor Alabama Freshwater Boating Access"

    "text": "Mobile-Tensaw River Delta\nThe Mobile–Tensaw River Delta, one of the largest and most ecologically diverse river deltas in the United States, encompasses more than 250,000 acres of rivers, swamps, marshes, and floodplain forests in coastal Alabama. Formed by the confluence of the Mobile, Tensaw, and Apalachee rivers, the delta is renowned as a premier freshwater fishing and wildlife system in the Southeast. Managed cooperatively by state and federal partners, with hydrology driven by natural river flows and upstream water control projects, the delta supports extensive aquatic habitat and productivity. These diverse environments sustain abundant fisheries, including largemouth bass, crappie spp., bream, striped bass, catfish, and a wide array of estuarine and migratory species.\n\nLocation: Southwest Alabama, north of Mobile Bay\nSize: 20,323 acres\nMax Depth: ~100\nImpounded: Free flowing from Claibourne and Coffeeville dams\n\n\n\nUpper Delta, LMBUpper Delta, CrappieLower Delta, LMBLower Delta, Crappie"
